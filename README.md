# Module-21-Challenge
# Deep Learning Charity Classifier

## Overview
This repository contains code for building a deep neural network (DNN) model to classify charitable organizations based on certain features. The goal is to predict whether a charity organization will be successful or not.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/charity-classifier.git
   cd charity-classifier
   pip install pandas scikit-learn tensorflow
python charity_classifier.py

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is "charity_data.csv" and can be found here.

Preprocessing
The dataset is loaded and non-beneficial columns like 'EIN' and 'NAME' are dropped.
Categorical variables are converted into numerical format using one-hot encoding.
Application types and classifications with low occurrences may be grouped into an "Other" category based on a chosen cutoff value.
Model Architecture
A deep neural network (DNN) model is built using TensorFlow and Keras.
The model consists of multiple layers, including input, hidden, and output layers.
The architecture can be customized by adjusting the number of hidden nodes and activation functions.
Training
The model is compiled with appropriate loss, optimizer, and evaluation metrics.
It is trained on a training dataset and evaluated on a testing dataset.
Hyperparameters and model performance can be fine-tuned as needed.
Results
Model performance metrics such as accuracy, loss, and any additional relevant metrics are tracked and recorded.
